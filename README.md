Virtual ATM Machine with Bank Management System - C++

This is a terminal-based virtual ATM simulation project made using core C++ programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, structures, and pointers. It simulates essential banking operations in a simple and interactive format.

Project Highlights

Login system using account number and PIN
Deposit money into the account
Withdraw money from the account
Check current account balance
Transfer money between user accounts
Change account PIN securely
Menu-driven interface that runs in a continuous loop

Concepts Used

Functions - Each banking operation is implemented as a separate function
Loops - Used to repeat the main menu and handle retry attempts
Conditionals - Used to validate user inputs and handle logical decisions
Structures - Each user account is represented using a structure
Pointers - Used to update user account data through function calls

Test User Accounts

Name: Alice
Account Number: 1001
PIN: 1234
Balance: 5000

Name: Bob
Account Number: 1002
PIN: 5678
Balance: 3000

Name: Charlie
Account Number: 1003
PIN: 2468
Balance: 7000

How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named atm\_system.cpp
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Compile the code using: g++ atm\_system.cpp -o atm\_system
4. Run the executable using: ./atm\_system
